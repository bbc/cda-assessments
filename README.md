# Corporate Digital & Applications Team Technical Assessments

Welcome ðŸ‘‹

This is where we keep some small projects to assess candidates joining our team.

Currently there's only one task to choose from:

- `commonwealth-api-task` A fake NodeJS API to fetch data about teams from the commonwealth games

## How it works

If you've applied for one of our roles, you may be invited to an interview/technical assessment and work on one of these projects during the assessment.

At the start of the technical assessment, you'll be given a list of tasks to implement and someone to pair with. The assessment is designed to be a collaborative excercise and you will be free to ask questions and use Google where needed.

A key aspect of the excercise is how you communicate your though process as you go along. You are not required to finish all the tasks in the given time.
