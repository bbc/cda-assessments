# Corporate Digital & Applications Team Technical Assessments

Welcome ðŸ‘‹

This is where we keep some small projects to assess candidates joining our team.

There are two directories, one for an api task and another for a front end task. Both in the theme of the recent commonwealth games

- `commonwealth-api-task` A fake NodeJS API to fetch data about teams
- `commonwealth-front-end-task` A basic React application to see results and country details utilising a mocked api

## How it works

If you've applied for one of our roles, you may be invited to an interview/technical assessment and work on one of these projects during the assessment.

At the start of the technical assessment, you'll be given a list of tasks to implement and someone to pair with. The assessment is designed to be a collaborative excercise and you will be free to ask questions and use Google where needed.

A key aspect of the excercise is how you communicate your though process as you go along. You are not required to finish all the tasks in the given time.
